Welcome to InundatEd, a novel, computationally efficient flood inundation modeling framework using the height above nearest drainage (HAND)-based solution for Manning's equation, implemented in a big-data discrete global grid system (DGGS)-based architecture with a web-GIS (Geographic Information Systems) platform presented as a Shiny App. Development and technical details are provided in the following:
